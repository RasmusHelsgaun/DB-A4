* **a)   Identify the most important nodes, based on their relationships** 
```cql
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('Graph', { maxIterations: 20, dampingFactor: 0.85 })
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
```

* **b)   Detect the close connected communities of nodes** 

* **c)   Discover similarity between nodes, based on their properties or behaviour** 

* **d)   Find available routes or optimal paths between the nodes**
